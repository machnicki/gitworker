Todo:
* consider Firebase vs Mongo vs Redis; how to make most effective live subscribe + actual repo data via github
* for time being no db - data keep in node scope
* apollo client + react / react native (for now only iOS) / desktop (electron - for now only OSX)
* push notification - browser, OSX, iOS
